# Audio-Source-Separation
In this project we perform audio source separation
by separating vocal and instrumental components of audio
signals. We compare the performance of the U-Net proposed
by Jansson et al and the baseline model on the MIR-1K
dataset. We apply data augmentation to analyse the performance
of models. The models are evaluated quantitatively using SDR,
SIR and SAR metrics and qualitatively through listening.
